sass properties
1. variables
2. operators
3. nesting
4. mixin>> function
5. mixin parameter
6. call from other pages



we can create diffrent files as  _var.scss and _mixin.scss and we will add our this page's rough data at those pages
copy paste all those things and paste them at there...
now simply import those files in main scss file  by:-
at the Top
import "filename"  (not require _ and also not require .scss)
